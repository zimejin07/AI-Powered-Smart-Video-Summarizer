In this video, we explore the fundamentals of machine learning and how they apply to real-world data.

We start by discussing the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning. Then we cover common algorithms like decision trees, linear regression, and neural networks.

By the end of this video, youâ€™ll have a basic understanding of how machine learning models are trained, evaluated, and deployed.
